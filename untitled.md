#LSTM Stock Predictor Closing
##Which model has lower loss?
### LSTM Stock Predictor using closing prices works much better than the FNG index. There seemed to be no discernable pattern to the FNG model.

##Which model tracks the actual values better over time?
### The LSTM Stock Predictor using closing prices predicts value better over time than the FNG index

##Which window size works best for the model?
### I was a little confused about this one with the FNG index because there was no discernable pattern no matter what window I put in, so I kept that one at 10. For the closing prices model, a window of 10 produced the best results.
